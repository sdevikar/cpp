## Introduction lecture:
- Always use the simplest data structure possible. In C++, **USE VECTORS!** if you can. If you can't use vectors, figure out a way to **USE VECTORS**
- An example discussed in the class discusses why using a combination of ```std::sort``` and ```std::unique``` for finding number of unique elements in an array is better than using a ```set```.
